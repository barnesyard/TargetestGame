This is a console app that I am creating to practicie code writing but here are the intentions with the code.
1. Take a grid as input and walk through a hueristic approach to solving the puzzle
2. Use OpenCV to scan a screenshot and generate a grid from a screenshot
3. Generate a random grid that one can solve for fun
4. Eventually I want to make a webservice that will have a UI that calls an API to get data to populate the UI. This is practice code that I will port to that webservice. I want to create a UI experience where usesrs can walk through the solving process one step at a time.
